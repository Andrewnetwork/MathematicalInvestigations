    "# Counting in Arbitrary Bases\n",

    "I wrote a botnet that orchestrated the distributed solution of problems. At its core was a counting mechanism. The first conception for the system was to brute force the cracking of passwords-- the simplest use case we thought of for distributed computing. In order to do this, we would count in the base of the length of the password character lexicon, and every number in that base could be easily translated to a possible password in that character set. More importantly, ranges of numbers would represent password combinations. These password ranges would be sent to computers in the botnet whereupon the range of passwords would be tried against some locked file -- I designed it so that it would send the password range to an executable, making it more robust than I'm making it seem. \n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation can count in any arbitrary base and is extremely efficient. The size of the counter is only limited by the memory capacity of the host computer, as we numpy ndarrayâ€™s as the core data structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more full featured version of this code will be released as a python package in the near future. "
